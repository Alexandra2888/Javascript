## lexical scope = lexical environment
= where you write smth, where we look for things(Js identifiers)
!in Js our lexical scope (available data + variables where the function was defined) determines our available variables, not where the function is called(dynamic scope)

## when you assign a value to an identifier -> target reference
## when you don't assign any value to identifier -> source reference

## Undefined => where a variable exists

## Undeclared => something that has never been formally declared in any scope that we have access to it.
