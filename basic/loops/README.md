## loops
loops repeat code while reducing the number of code

* for, while, dom, forEach

## steps
1: a variable is defined (a starting point),

2: the ending point is defined,

3: how much the variable is incremented

for(initialExpression; comdition; incrementExpression) {

    the code we want to run
    
}

## while
= with a while loop wee check the condition first and then do the stuff, in a do while loop first we do then stuff and then check the condition.

## steps: declare a variable

while(condition) {run the code}
