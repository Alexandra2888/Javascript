## functions = first class citizens

## HOF(higher order functions)
-a function taht can take as an argument a function or a function that returns another function.

## closures
- a combination of function and the lexical environment from which it was declared -> closures allow a function to access variables from an enclosing scope or environement, even after it was declared. The child scope always has access to the parent' scope.
-> function ran, executed -> it's never going to execute again but it's going to remember that there are refrences to those variables so the child scope always has access to the parent' scope
! parents don't have access to the childrens'  scope.
* closure = when a function is able to remember and acess its lexical scope, even if that function executes in a different scope

## inheritance
- inheritance is an object getting access to the properties + methods of another object.
