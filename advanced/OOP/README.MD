## 3 PILLARS OF OOP
* clear + understandable
* easy to extend
* easy to maintain
* more efficient

## this keyword = Js version of a dynamic scope, a way of having flexible, reusable behaviour

## Instance = something created with the "new" keyword

## First class -> ! add the constructor mwthod that willl enable the creation of instances(objects) based on our class

## First instances -< to create an object from this constructor method we need to use the new keyword and pass in the given anme and age of the animal object that we are creating. We also have added a getInfo method that returns the information about the object


## Inheritance = class inheritance is a feature that enables certain classes to take all the methods and properties of another one (parent class) and makes it possible to extend the parent class by adding more

## Encapsulation = is a restriction mechanism making accessing the data impossible without using special methods dedicated for this. In the example below we marked weight as a private property and in order to get and set a value we need to use the getter and setter method


## Polymorphism = is a concept that utilizes inheritance for reusing methods multiple time with a different behaviour depending on class types -> in the dog class we will remove the bark method and in the animal class we'll add a makeSound method which will be overrriden by cat and dog classes
