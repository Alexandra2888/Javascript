Challenge 1

John has 3 friends and his best friend is ccalled Michael


##
Challenge 2

BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter)

1. for each of them create an object with properties for their full name, mass and height (Mark Miller and John Doe)

2. create a 'clacBMI' method on each object to calculate the BMI (the same method on both objects), store the BMI value to a propery and return it from the method

3. log in the console who has the higher BMI with the full name and BMI eg John's BMI (28.3) is higher than Mark's (23.9)

Test data: Mark:78kg and 1.69m and John 92kg and 1.95m

Challenge 3

1. Loop over the game.scored array and print each player name to the console, along with the goal number (Example: "Goal 1: Lewandowski")

2. Use a loop to calculate the average odd and log it to the console (We already studied how to calculate averages, you can go check if you don't remember)

3. Print the 3 odds to the console, but in a nice formatted way, exaclty like this:
      Odd of victory Bayern Munich: 1.33
      Odd of draw: 3.25
      Odd of victory Borrussia Dortmund: 6.5
      
Get the team names directly from the game object, don't hardcode them (except for "draw"). HINT: Note how the odds and the game objects have the same property names ðŸ˜‰
BONUS: Create an object called 'scorers' which contains the names of the players who scored as properties, and the number of goals as the value. In this game, it will look like this:
      {
        Gnarby: 1,
        Hummels: 1,
        Lewandowski: 2
      }
